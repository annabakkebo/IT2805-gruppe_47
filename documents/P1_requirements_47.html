        The purpose of the website is to have a platform of information to mainly parents. Through this platform
        the teachers, the principal and admin at the school can publish necessary information for the parents and pupils
        to read. The most important information that is relevant to all parents and pupils will be posted on the main
        page.
        There will be a search bar where users can search for relevant
        information.
