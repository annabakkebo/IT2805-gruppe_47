    <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of the website is to have a platform of information to both pupils and parents. Through this platform
        the teachers, the principal and admin at the school can publish necessary information for the parents and pupils
        to read. The most important information that is relevant to all parents and pupils will be posted on the main
        page. In addition there will also be pages for each class where the teacher will post information that is
        relevant for the pupils and parents of that class. It will also be possible to subscribe to the different
        information channels.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website will also contain contact information for all the employees at the school.

    <h2>Final location</h2>
    <p>
        We will not publish the site, so the site will not reside anywhere after the project. Although we do use GitHub
        to share the project, so it might be there when the project is done.
