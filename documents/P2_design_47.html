    <h2> Our client: La Escuela </h2>
    <p>
        Our client, Arne Brillestad, is the headmaster at La Escuela. La Escuela is a private elementary school in
        Norway.
        The school has creativity and sustainability as their main focuses.

    <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
    <p>

        The website will function as the main information hub from the school to its
        users. The parents will here be able to retrieve important information about the school as well as be able to
        apply for their children to attend the school.
    </p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The website is aimed mainly towards parents of current or future pupils. Pupils can also use the site, but it
        will mostly be directed towards the parents. Parents often have a need to get information about what their
        children
        are doing every day. The children often get information at school, but forget to tell their parents. This
        website
        will therefore be able to fill that need for information for the parents.

    <h2>Navigation structure</h2>
    <p>
        The navigation structure of La Escuela's website can be described as a clique, as all the webpages are linked to
        each other. This can be seen visually in the picture below. Every page has a navigation bar and a footer, where
        it is possible to access all of the pages included in the website.

    </ul>
    <h4>Navigation bar</h4>
    <p>
        The navigation bar will be available on all the pages of the website. It will be sticky, meaning it will always
        at the top of the screen. When clicking the about button it will open a menu below the navigation bar. This menu
        will not be sticky.
    </p>
    <h4>Footer</h4>
    <p>
        The footer will be on the bottom of the page. If the page isn't filled with content the footer will be at the
        bottom of the page. If it is filled with content the footer will be pushed below the content. The footer will
        contain contact information and links to the different parts of the website.
    </p>
    <h4>Fulfillment of goals </h4>
    <p>
        With having the navigation bar available on all pages it becomes easy to navigate through the different parts of
        the website. <br>
        With having both the text and the links grey or black it projects some sence of maturity from the school.
        We wanted this because the audience are the parents of the children and might be looking for a serious school
        that is mature and knows how to relate to parents, as well as children.
