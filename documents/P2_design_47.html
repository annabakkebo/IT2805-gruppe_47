    <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
    <p>

        The website will function as the main information hub from the school to its
        users. The parents will here be able to retrieve important information about the school as well as be able to
        apply for their children to attend the school.

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The website is aimed mainly towards parents of current or future pupils. Pupils can also use the site, but it
        will mostly be directed towards the parents. Parents often have a need to get information about what their children
        are doing every day. The children often get information at school, but forget to tell their parents. This website
        will therefore be able to fill that need for information for the parents.
