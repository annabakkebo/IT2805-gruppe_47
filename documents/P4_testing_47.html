    <h2> Testing Document </h2>
    <p>
        The testing document is a Google Form, and focuses on how easy it is to navigate the website, how accesible the
        information is, what worked well and what could be improved. The user is also asked to give up their age and if
        they would send their children to the school, after seeing the website. Lastly we ask about what kind of unit
        they used to access the website. Link to the Google Form: <a href = "https://forms.gle/edConRtxHQbwsABW9"> https://forms.gle/edConRtxHQbwsABW9</a>
