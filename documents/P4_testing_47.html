    <h2> Our client: La Escuela </h2>
    <p>
        Our client, Arne Brillestad, is the headmaster at La Escuela. La Escuela is a private elementary school in
        Norway.
        The school has creativity and sustainability as their main focuses.

    <h2> Testing Document </h2>
    <p>
        The testing document is a Google Form, and focuses on how easy it is to navigate the website, how accesible the
        information is, what worked well and what could be improved. The user is also asked to give up their age and if
        they would send their children to the school, after seeing the website. Lastly we ask about what kind of device
        they used to access the website. Link to the Google Form: <a href = "https://forms.gle/edConRtxHQbwsABW9"> https://forms.gle/edConRtxHQbwsABW9</a>

    <h2> Tester Audience </h2>
<p>
    As most students our age do not have children, we asked parents, elder siblings and others with children to test the website.
    We still ended up with 50% of the audience being between the ages of 18-23. 33.3% of the audience were between 23-30
    and the final 16.7% of the audience were over 60 years old. We were able to do some live testing as well, and this
    made it easier for us to understand the difficulties that the testers were experiencing, as it was possible to see
    what went wrong in the moment.

    <h2> Testing Platforms </h2>
    <p>The testers used smartphones, macs and windows computers. The browsers used were Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari.</p>

    <h2> Feedback Summary </h2>
<p>
    100% of all the testers answered either 4 or 5 out of 5 on how easy it was to navigate the webpage. 83.4% of the testers
    found the information about the school to be relevant and accessible. To make the information more accessible, there were
    suggestions to remove the about menu, and instead have all the links to the various pages accessible in the header at
    all times. Another suggestion was to make the menu buttons bigger for smart phone users, as the testers found the
    menu buttons to be too small, and thus difficult to use.</p>
    <p> The design received positive feedback, as the testing audience
    felt it was simple, efficient and orderly. However, some of the testers would have liked a different color scheme,
    different text font and generally a different way of formatting the text. One tester also commented on how it liked
    the two different representations of the calendar.
</p>
    <p>
        We also got feedback regarding the structure of information. Some would like even more of the information to be
        featured on the front page. There were also feedback on the lack of concrete facts about the school, as
        curriculum, school transport, parking, values etc.

    <h2> Our Response </h2>
<p>
    We are fortunate to have such specific suggestions on how to make the website better. If this had in fact been a real
    client and we had time on our hands, we could make several small and effective changes. Since this is not the case,
    all we will do is to say what we could do.
    Some of the reported problems for smart phone users would easily be adressed by making the buttons bigger, but we would
    rather make the site wholly responsive for mobile phones rather than changing the whole site. The menu could in fact
    be more intuitive and an easy measure could be to add an arrow to "About" as was in the original design. We could also
    think about making the whole menu a dropdown "burger"-menu, this would also make it easier to make a mobile friendly site.</p>
<p>
    The color scheme and text fonts is something which could be remedied, but could then spark a larger redesign. Before
    we would consider this in any serious degree, we would have to get more input as it now is only one response which mentions
    the colors and text fonts respectively.
</p>
    <p>
        The responses on information structure is valuable, and if we would actually have a bigger redesign, we would try
        to implement as much of the suggestions as possible. When it comes to lack of concrete information, we can't do that
        much without an actual real-life client.

    <h2> Self Reflection </h2>
<p>
    More difficult to know what a tester means when you cannot see them, or ask them what they meant. Understand the
    value of having some live testing. Interesting experience in how to work on coding as a group. Interesting to try
    and make a whole and "real" webpage, with specifications and design challenges.
