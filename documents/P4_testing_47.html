    <h2> Our client: La Escuela </h2>
    <p>
        Our client, Arne Brillestad, is the headmaster at La Escuela. La Escuela is a private elementary school in
        Norway.
        The school has creativity and sustainability as their main focuses.

    <h2> Testing Document </h2>
    <p>
        The testing document is a Google Form, and focuses on how easy it is to navigate the website, how accesible the
        information is, what worked well and what could be improved. The user is also asked to give up their age and if
        they would send their children to the school, after seeing the website. Lastly we ask about what kind of device
        they used to access the website. Link to the Google Form: <a href = "https://forms.gle/edConRtxHQbwsABW9"> https://forms.gle/edConRtxHQbwsABW9</a>

    <h2> Tester Audience </h2>
<p>
    As most students our age do not have children, we asked parents, elder siblings and others with children to test the website.
    We still ended up with 50% of the audience being between the ages of 18-23. 33.3% of the audience were between 23-30
    and the final 16.7% of the audience were over 60 years old. We were able to do some live testing as well, and this
    made it easier for us to understand the difficulties that the testers were experiencing, as it was possible to see
    what went wrong in the moment.

    <h2> Feedback Summary </h2>
<p>
    100% of all the testers answered either 4 or 5 out of 5 on how easy it was to navigate the webpage. 83.4% of the testers
    found the information about the school to be relevant and accessible. To make the information more accessible, there were
    suggestions to remove the about menu, and instead have all the links to the various pages accessible in the header at
    all times. Another suggestion was to make the menu buttons bigger for smart phone users, as the testers found the
    menu buttons to be too small, and thus difficult to use. The design received positive feedback, as the testing audience
    felt it was simple, efficient and orderly. However, some of the testers would have liked a different color scheme,
    different text font and generally a different way of formatting the text. One tester also commented on how it liked
    the two different representations of the calendar.

    <h2> Our Response </h2>
<p>
The problems for the smart phone users will be addressed by making the buttons bigger. The color scheme will have to stay
    the same, as it is La Escuela's school colors. The text font can easily be changed an will be in the future. The text
    formatting is as the school intended it to be...
