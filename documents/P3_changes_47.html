    <h2>Fulfillment of requirements</h2>
    <p>
        Jens met the requirements for the slideshow by making a user-defined function in slide.js.
        Robert met the requirements for the application form, by validating form inputs in the file admission/index.html
        and then sending the form with the "mailto" action. Endre met the requirements for the calendar by making
        user-defined functions in calendar.js and implemented the dropdown menu for each page. Anna implemented the homepage
        and the contact us page, and added functionality to the contact us page through user-defined functions in contact.js.

    <h2>The changes we have made</h2>
    <p>
        There have been no changes made concerning the amount of webpages, but there were many design and structural changes.
        These changes are summarised below.
    </p>
    <h3> New files </h3>
    <p>Added calendar.css and contact.css. This seems to be in disregard of the guidelines saying we should have all css
    in one local file. This is true, but it makes for a much easier way to locate relevant css, and the complexity it adds to
        the project as a whole is minimal, I would even argue that it minimizes complexity by making the file navigation more
        accesible. </p>
    <p>Added contactInfo.js. This js file was added to have a convenient place to make and store the personnel files and
        to create a personnel list.
    </p>
    <h3> Changes to existing files </h3>
    <p>Changed the name of the js file slideshow.js to slide.js. </p>


    <h3> Removal of files </h3>
    <p>
        The application.js was removed entirely, as the admission/index.html handled all of the necessary data for the
        application scheme. The languageChange.js was also removed entirely, because we found out that the added
        complexity of making the site bilingual was not worth all the extra work involved. It would also make the code
        harder to navigate, as we would have to add a norwegian and english equivalence at each string-point.The
        application infoGet.js was removed entirely, as in the end we did not have a script functionality for taking
        information from the blog page to the front-page. The reason for not implementing this functionality was
        mainly that we needed to use functionality that was to advanced (like XHTML-request).
    </p>

    <h3>Design and functionality</h3>
    <h4>Index-page</h4>
    <p> Removed the functionality of retrieving information from other pages and posting it on the front page.
        This was considered to advanced without database/server/php, thus it was scrapped in the design. Instead
        of a script that retrieves the first x chars or words from the three latest blog post, there will be
        the blog articles manually written.</p>
    <h4>Slideshow</h4>
    <p> Removed the quotes above the slideshow pictures, as they did not look as professional as we wanted them
        to be.</p>
    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>Removed the list of facilities, as this could easily be included in the text about the school.</p>

    <h4>Calendar</h4>
    <p>The calendar has a few changes to the design, a couple added functionalities and one removed functionality. The
    site-wide (as in both in "index.html" and "about/calendar.html") added functionality is that it is made a "pop-up"
    when one clicks on a red-circle indicating an event, and one can navigate between month with the arrows around the
    month-name (this was only indicated as a possibility on the calendar-page, but got added on the front-page as well.
    On the calendar page the main focus through design changes are on the calendar, and with the added functionality
        where one can toggle calendar- and list-view in the upper right corner.</p>
    <p>We did not add an actual link between the front-page calendar and the calendar-page calendar as that would require
    us learning either ajax or xhtmlrequest, which none of us were any keen on doing. In an possible extension of this project,
    this is a functionality that could easily be added with php, and databases. </p>
    <h4>Navigation bar</h4>
    <p>The navigation bar lost its arrow behind "About", through sheer forgetfulness. We decided against keeping the bar
    fixed in the display-ports upper part, since it didn't add anything of importance to fixate it.</p>
    <h4>Admission form</h4>
    <p>
        The admission form had only minor design changes and one functionality change. Originally the form would
        have been sent to a server, however we were not allowed to use php, so we landed on using the "mailto" action
        instead. This opens the users default email system and lets them send an already filled out email by clicking send.
        The minor design changes were due to that it looked better then the original mockup.
